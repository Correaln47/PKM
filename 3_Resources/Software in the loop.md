# General Concept
This process simulates the entire robot and environment on a single computer. This is used mainly for early-stage development, where the mechanical structure is still in a design process, or access to physical hardware is limited/risky. The robot's sensors and actuators are simulated, and the control code processes the simulated sensor data and sends commands back to the simulator to replicate movement or interactions. If done correctly, SIL can help validate and even calibrate control systems by running hundreds or even thousands of tests in a short amount of time, which would take much longer in a real-world testing situation.

# Why?
Simulation is a fundamental part on investigating and validating robotic software, as it is a practical and effcient alternative to physical testing
## Challenges in Physical Testing
Physically replicating all the possible scenarios is a very time-consuming, resource intensive, impractial and expensive procedure.
For recognition tasks things like: **Backgrounds, Lighting conditions, object placements, possible actions the robot can take** Need to be replicated in the most amount of variations possible 
For movement is the same concept: **Roughness of the terrain, different possible friction between parts of the robot, unexpected surface changes**.
In general, predicting every possible scenario is a hard and sometimes impossible task. 

# How?
### Simulation for Ai training and testing
AI models best ability is to interpolate, working with known conditions, and lack considerably when extrapolating. This makes it important to make the training data as generalized as possible. 
Simulation environments allow to train models in a wide variety of scenarios. 

This is SIL. It enables testing and training software on a simualted enviroment, separate from any part of the robot. This ensures that most of the decision making systems can be validated before any deployement.

# Tools
Programs like [[Isaac SIM MOC|Isaac Sim]] enable this development.
