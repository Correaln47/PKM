Offline Programming is a **programming method** focused on production efficiency and minimizing downtime. It involves creating a complete program for a _**real**_ robot in a virtual 3D environment that simulates the robot with everything necessary to replicate the task environment. The primary goal is to design, test, and optimize a robot's tasks, like path planning, manipulation, etc, before it's ever deployed where it would be functioning. The simulation allows to check for potential collisions, verify reachability, and fine tune parameters and in general optimize the function of the robot when its hard to replicate the environment IRL or is dangerous to do so. Once the program is done, it's transferred to the physical robot's controller for execution. This is different from SIL, which is a **testing methodology** focused on validating the low level control code's logic for a robot that is not “finished” yet, not on creating a high level task program.

Simulation programs like Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, AirSim, CoppeliaSim, are the main tools used for this, and they are connected with frameworks to replicate as if the robot was actually running the program.
